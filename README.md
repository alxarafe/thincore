# thincore
Project that links the Alxarafe options to make a simple, flexible and powerful application engine

NOTE: Include the alxarafe/alxarafe_folder repository in the /alxarafe folder in order to use this application.

This core, still in development, will allow you to easily create applications with user identification and highly automated table and view management.
